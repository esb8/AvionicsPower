## Overview

This project is a custom RP2040-based **Power Distribution Board**, designed for use in an avionics stack comprising three CAN-connected PCBs:  
- Sensor Board  
- Power Distribution Board **(this board) ** 
- GPS Board

The system is intended for **high-power model rocketry**, and this boardâ€™s primary role is to **distribute power** to the rest of the system while also managing essential subsystems such as communication, monitoring, and recovery signaling.

## ðŸ“¡ PCB Features

- High-current 3.3â€¯V synchronous buck converter (up to 3â€¯A), operating at 1.5â€¯MHz and ~95% efficiency  
- Low-noise LDO with 60â€¯dB PSRR @ 100â€¯Hz, delivering up to 500â€¯mA at 3.3â€¯V  
- Single-cell Li-ion/LiPo battery protection IC with over-voltage, under-voltage, and over-current protection  
- CAN controller and transceiver  
- RP2040 microcontroller  
- USB-C interface  
- Onboard status LEDs for buck converter, MCU status, and USB-C diagnostics  
- External 128â€¯Mbit W25Q128JVS flash memory  
- MAX98357A IÂ²S digital amplifier connected to a speaker for audible recovery

## âœ… PCB Design Criteria

This board was designed to meet the following system-level criteria:

- **Stable, low-noise 3.3â€¯V rail** for analog/digital loads â€” supports up to 500â€¯mA with minimal line/load regulation (target: Â±0.1%)
- **High-current 3.3â€¯V rail** capable of supplying up to 3â€¯A to downstream PCBs
- **Battery protection** for a 1S LiPo cell, including self-recovery from under-voltage and short-circuit protection
- **CAN bus communication interface** to enable modular system design with multiple nodes
- **Audible recovery system** â€” implemented using the **MAX98357A IÂ²S Class-D amplifier**, which drives a speaker directly from the RP2040 using digital audio
